# FlexiSourceTestApp

Thank you for your interest in becoming part of the tech team at TyreConnect.
The experience you have outlined in your resume is in line with the requirements for this position,
and I would now like to invite you to complete the next stage of the application process which
involves completing a simple .NET Core test.
Please make sure your solution meets all of the following requirements and has a GUI in Angular
that works:
 Accepts two strings as input: one string is called &quot;text&quot; and the other is called &quot;subtext&quot; in
this problem statement,
 Matches the subtext against the text, outputting the character positions of the beginning of
each match for the subtext within the text.
 Allows multiple matches
 Allows case insensitive matching
 
The simple nature of the test allows the candidate time to spend time showcasing their
understanding of software development. The successful solution needs satisfy ALL the requirements
laid out in the code test.
 
 75% of candidates fail this test based on the following
 No unit tests 
 No usage of object-oriented concepts
 No naming conventions followed 
 Breaks in the simple scenario of search string being bigger than the main string 
 No Angular UI
 Bad function signature
 Fails on some scenarios
 
Candidates who pass the test do so for the following:
 Implemented their own unit tests
 Good test coverage
 Good algorithm
 Good implementation
 Good solution structure 
Use this opportunity to shows the ability to understand requirements, design and implement an
elegant, understandable, maintainable and tested code.
After completion host the application on any provider of your liking (with a public URL) and upload
the code on to GitHub.
PLEASE ENSURE YOUR SOLUTION PASSES ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. 
Good luck.
